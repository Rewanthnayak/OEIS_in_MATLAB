# A265326 	n-th prime minus its binary reversal.
**[A265326 - OEIS](https://oeis.org/A265326)** is a sequence resulting from substracting reversal of prime number in base-2 from the prime number itself in base-2 and plotting the result in base 10.   

|n|Prime|Binary|reverse|Result|
|-|-----|------|-------|------|
|1|2|10|01|1|
|2|3|11|11|0|
|3|5|101|101|0|
|4|7|111|111|0|
|5|11|1011|1101|-2|
|6|13|1101|1011|2|  


>EX:  for n=5: 11 (5<sup>th</sup> Prime number) in binary is *1011* its reverse is *1101*  
>* 		ie A265326(n=5) = 1011 - 1101 = -2  
>				    (11)-(13)

### plotting A265326(n) against n gives this parallelogram pattern
#### at every power 0f 2 the patttern restarts and a new parallelogram starts from there
